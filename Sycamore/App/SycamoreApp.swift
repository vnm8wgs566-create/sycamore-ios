//  Sycamore
//
//  The entry point. It owns exactly one thing — the `AppStore` — and hands it to
//  `RootView`, which decides what a person is looking at.
//
//  The design is drawn light-only (every surface is white or one of two near-white greys),
//  so the app pins its colour scheme rather than shipping a half-finished dark palette.
